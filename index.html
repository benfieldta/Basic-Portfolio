	<p>Hi, I'm Travis Benfield. I am a 28 year old husband and father to a 1 year old little boy. I have a passion for web development and desire to improve the way people interact with the internet on a daily basis with the programs that I write.</p>

	<p> In this portfolio, you will see some of the recent projects that I have been working on. Please connect with me via one of the links that I have included here or feel free to contact me through the "Contact" portion of the page. I would love to hear from you and get feedback on my projects or even potentially collaborate in the future.</p>
